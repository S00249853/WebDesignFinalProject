            <h2> What are Corvids?</h2>
           
            <img id ="corvids"  src="Images/crowGrey.jpg" alt="crow">
            <p> Corvidae is a cosmopolitan family of oscine passerine birds that contains the crows, ravens, rooks, 
                magpies, jackdaws, jays, treepies, choughs, and nutcrackers. In colloquial English, they 
                are known as the crow family or corvids. Currently, 135 species are included in this family. 
                The genus Corvus containing 47 species makes up over a third of the entire family.
                Corvids (ravens) are the largest passerines. Corvids display remarkable intelligence for animals 
                of their size, and are among the most intelligent birds thus far studied. Specifically, members 
                of the family have demonstrated self-awareness in mirror tests (Eurasian magpies) and tool-making 
                ability (e.g. crows and rooks), skills which until recently were thought to be possessed only by 
                humans and a few other higher mammals. Their total brain-to-body mass ratio is equal to that of 
                non-human great apes and cetaceans, and only slightly lower than that of humans. They are medium to 
                large in size, with strong feet and bills, rictal bristles, and a single moult each year 
                (most passerines moult twice). Corvids are found worldwide, except for the southern tip of 
                South America and the polar ice caps. The majority of the species are found in tropical South and 
                Central America and in southern Asia, with fewer than 10 species each in Africa and Australasia. 
                The genus Corvus has re-entered Australia in relatively recent geological prehistory, with five 
                species and one subspecies there. Several species of raven have reached oceanic islands, and some of 
                these species are now highly threatened with extinction, or have already become extinct. This is a college project
