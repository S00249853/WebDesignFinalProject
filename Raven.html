            The common raven (Corvus corax) is a large all-black passerine bird. It is the most widely distributed 
            of all corvids, found across the Northern Hemisphere. It is a raven known by many names at the 
            subspecies level; there are at least eight subspecies with little variation in appearance, although 
            recent research has demonstrated significant genetic differences among populations from various 
            regions. It is one of the two largest corvids, alongside the thick-billed raven, and is possibly the 
            heaviest passerine bird; at maturity, the common raven averages 63 centimetres (25 inches) in length and 
            1.47 kilograms (3.2 pounds) in mass. Although their typical lifespan is considerably shorter, common 
            ravens can live more than 23 years in the wild. Young birds may travel in flocks but later mate for 
            life, with each mated pair defending a territory. Common ravens have coexisted with humans for thousands 
            of years and in some areas have been so numerous that people have regarded them as pests. Part of their 
            success as a species is due to their omnivorous diet; they are extremely versatile and opportunistic in 
            finding sources of nutrition, feeding on carrion, insects, cereal grains, berries, fruit, small animals, 
            nesting birds, and food waste. Some notable feats of problem-solving provide evidence that the common 
            raven is unusually intelligent. Over the centuries, the raven has been the subject of mythology, 
            folklore, art, and literature. In many cultures, including the indigenous cultures of Scandinavia, 
            ancient Ireland and Wales, Bhutan, the northwest coast of North America, and Siberia and northeast 
            Asia, the common raven has been revered as a spiritual figure or godlike creature.

        <h2>Fun Facts</h2>
        <ol>
            <li class="answer">Ravens have very few natural enemies.
                The main enemies of ravens are the raptors, such as the Golden Eagle, falcons, and 
                Great Horned Owls. These birds, however, depend on ravens, which are passerines, capable of p
                erching on their feet, to build their nests. Sometimes ravens and the birds that prey on them 
                have nested on cliffs just a few feet from each other.
            
            
            </li>
        <li class="answer">Groups of ravens are described in colorful terms.
            We’re used to talking about “flocks” of birds, and it is proper to refer to a “flock” of ravens.
            However, a group of ravens may also be described as a “conspiracy,” a “rave,” an “unkindness,” or 
            a “treachery.” The pejorative references to ravens probably originated with the observation that 
            not only do ravens feeds on larger dead animals, like deer and moose, they also call other ravens 
            to join in the feast of dead game.
        
        </li>
        <li class="answer">Ravens sometimes adopt the eggs of other birds.
            Ravens instinctively react to round objects as potential food, because they usually are. 
            If they encounter a chicken egg, a robin egg, an Easter egg, or even an ostrich egg lying on the 
            ground, they will automatically peck at it and try to eat it. Raven eggs are greenish-blue with 
            brown spots. However, if a raven encounters a strange white, red, or blue egg in its nest, its 
            reaction seems to be “Did I lay that?” and to leave it alone, allowing it to hatch. This ensures 
            that the mating ravens don’t accidentally expel one of their hatchlings.
